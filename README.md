# Atom syntax highlighting for Asteroid

Asteroid is a multi-paradigm programming language heavily influenced by [Python](https://www.python.org), [Lua](http://www.lua.org), [ML](https://www.smlnj.org), and [Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org) currently under development at the University of Rhode Island.  Asteroid implements a new programming paradigm called *pattern-matching oriented programming*.  In this new programming paradigm patterns and pattern matching is supported by all major programming language constructs making programs succinct and robust.  Furthermore, patterns themselves are first-class citizens and as such can be passed and returned from functions as well as manipulated computationally.
